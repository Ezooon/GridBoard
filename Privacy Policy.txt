Grid Board does not gather or retain any personal data, except for the game sets that you produce. These game sets will be saved locally on your device as files and directories that you are free to manage as you desire. Moreover, if you wish to incorporate your game set in the upcoming release, please feel free to contact me via email at mreisevil@gmail.com.
